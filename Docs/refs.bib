abstract = {Optimal design and operation of multi-energy systems involving seasonal energy storage are often hindered by the complexity of the optimization problem. Indeed, the description of seasonal cycles requires a year-long time horizon, while the system operation calls for hourly resolution; this turns into a large number of decision variables, including binary variables, when large systems are analyzed. This work presents novel mixed integer linear program methodologies that allow considering a year time horizon with hour resolution while significantly reducing the complexity of the optimization problem. First, the validity of the proposed techniques is tested by considering a simple system that can be solved in a reasonable computational time without resorting to design days. Findings show that the results of the proposed approaches are in good agreement with the full-scale optimization, thus allowing to correctly size the energy storage and to operate the system with a long-term policy, while significantly simplifying the optimization problem. Furthermore, the developed methodology is adopted to design a multi-energy system based on a neighborhood in Zurich, Switzerland, which is optimized in terms of total annual costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Finally the system behavior is revealed by performing a sensitivity analysis on different features of the energy system and by looking at the topology of the energy hub along the Pareto sets.},

For this, a new electricity module is developed in POLES (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems). It now takes into account the impacts of VRES on the European power system. The power system operation relies on EUCAD (European Unit Commitment and Dispatch), which includes daily storage and other inter-temporal constraints. The innovative aspect of our work is the direct coupling between POLES and EUCAD, thus combining a long-term simulation horizon and a short-term approach for the power system operation. The storage technologies represented are pumped-hydro storage, lithium-ion batteries, adiabatic compressed air energy storage (a-CAES) and electric vehicles (charging optimisation and vehicle-to-grid). Demand response and European grid interconnections are also represented in order to include, to some extent, these flexibility options.},

abstract = {The design of transition pathways for sustainable electricity systems with high penetrations of renewable energy sources requires the use of energy modeling tools that are able to account for two key aspects: the evolution of fossil fuels and technology prices, and the natural dynamics of renewable resources. However, the modeling methodologies most currently used focus on only one of these two aspects, which hinders their suitability for performing long-term analysis with high penetrations of renewable energy sources. This paper presents a modeling framework that is able to optimize the investment in new renewable generation capacity on the long-term while taking into account the hourly dynamics of electricity supply and demand. The framework combines two of the most used energy planning tools, each able to account for one of the aspects of the modeling of energy systems. The framework was applied to continental Portugal for the time period of 2005-2050, in order to identify optimal investment plans in new renewable and fossil generation capacity with the goal of achieving significant CO2 emissions reduction, under different scenarios. The results show that the inclusion of dynamics in the modeling methodology can help avoid overinvestment and reduce the excess of electricity from renewable energy sources that cannot be used by the system. These results can have a significant impact on the design of a sustainable electricity system and may lead to a diversification of the energy sources used. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1969-2012 IEEE. Due to computational restrictions, energy-system optimization models (ESOMs) and generation expansion planning models (GEPMs) frequently represent intraannual variations in demand and supply by using the data of a limited number of representative historical days. The vast majority of the current approaches to select a representative set of days relies on either simple heuristics or clustering algorithms and comparison of different approaches is restricted to different clustering algorithms. This paper contributes by: I) proposing criteria and metrics for evaluating representativeness, ii) providing a novel optimization-based approach to select a representative set of days, and iii) evaluating and comparing the developed approach to multiple approaches available from the literature. The developed optimization-based approach is shown to achieve more accurate results than the approaches available from the literature. As a consequence, by applying this approach to select a representative set of days, the accuracy of ESOMs/GEPMs can be improved without increasing the computational cost. The main disadvantage is that the approach is computationally costly and requires an implementation effort.},

abstract = {Optimizing the configuration and operation of a CHP system for a whole year becomes a computationally demanding task when, for example, integer variables are used to model the status (on/off) of different pieces of equipment. The reason is that a discrete optimization problem is fundamentally an enumerative problem, featuring that the number of possible solutions grows exponentially with the number of integer variables. This computational difficulty is known as the curse of dimensionality, and severely limits the chances to use mixed integer programming methods to design CHP systems. To work out this problem, this paper presents a new and unambiguous method to reduce a full year of demand data to a few representative days that adequately preserve significant characteristics such as the peak demands, the demand duration curves, and the temporal inter-relationship between the different types of demands (power, heating, and cooling). Days are selected using a partitional clustering method known as the k-medoids method, and their ability to resemble the original data is tested by means of two quality indexes and a calendar visual inspection. Two case studies are discussed for the completeness of the paper, showing how the method and the quality indexes can be used in practice. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@phdthesis{Moret2017PhDThesis,
abstract = {Various countries and communities are defining or rethinking their energy strategy driven by concerns for climate change and security of energy supply. Energy models, often based on optimization, can support this decision-making process. In the current energy planning practice, most models are deterministic, i.e. they do not consider uncertainty and rely on long-term forecasts for important parameters. However, over the long time horizons of energy planning, forecasts often prove to be inaccurate, which can lead to overcapacity and underutilization of the installed technologies. Although this shows the need of considering uncertainty in energy planning, uncertainty is to date seldom integrated in energy models. The main barriers to a wider penetration of uncertainty are i) the complexity and computational expense of energy models; ii) the issue of quantifying input uncertainties and determining their nature; iii) the selection of appropriate methods for incorporating uncertainties in energy models. To overcome these limitations, this thesis answers the following research question How does uncertainty impact strategic energy planning and how can we facilitate the integration of uncertainty in the energy modeling practice? with four novel methodological contributions. First, a mixed-integer linear programming modeling framework for large-scale energy systems is presented. Given the energy demand, the efficiency and cost of energy conversion technologies, the availability and cost of resources, the model identifies the optimal investment and operation strategies to meet the demand and minimize the total annual cost or greenhouse gas emissions. The concise formulation and low computational time make it suitable for uncertainty applications. Second, a method is introduced to characterize input uncertainties in energy planning models. Third, the adoption of a two-stage global sensitivity analysis approach is proposed to deal with the large number of uncertain parameters in energy planning models. Fourth, a complete robust optimization framework is developed to incorporate uncertainty in optimization-based energy models, allowing to consider uncertainty both in the objective function and in the other constraints. To evaluate the impact of uncertainty, the presentation of the methods is systematically associated to their validation on the real case study of the Swiss energy system. In this context, a novelty is represented by the consideration of all uncertain parameters in the analysis. The main finding is that uncertainty dramatically impacts energy planning decisions. The results reveal that uncertainty levels vary significantly for different parameters, and that the way in which uncertainty is characterized has a strong impact on the results. In the case study, economic parameters, such as the discount rate and the price of imported resources, are the most impacting inputs; also, parameters which are commonly considered as fixed assumptions in energy models emerge as critical factors, which shows that it is crucial to avoid an a priori exclusion of parameters from the analysis. The energy strategy drastically changes if uncertainty is considered. In particular, it is demonstrated that robust solutions, characterized by a higher penetration of renewables and of efficient technologies, can offer more reliability and stability compared to investment plans made without accounting for uncertainty, at the price of a marginally higher cost.},

abstract = {The transition towards more sustainable, fossil-free energy systems is interlinked with a high penetration of stochastic renewables, such as wind and solar. Integrating these new energy resources and technologies will lead to profound structural changes in energy systems, such as an increasing need for storage and a radical electrification of the heating and mobility sectors. To capture the increasing complexity of such future energy systems, new flexible and open-source optimization modelling tools are needed. This paper presents EnergyScope TD, a novel open-source model for the strategic energy planning of urban and regional energy systems. Compared to other existing energy models, which are often proprietary, computationally expensive and mostly focused on the electricity sector, EnergyScope TD optimises both the investment and operating strategy of an entire energy system (including electricity, heating and mobility). Additionally, its hourly resolution (using typical days) makes the model suitable for the integration of intermittent renewables, and its concise mathematical formulation and computational efficiency are appropriate for uncertainty applications. We present the linear programming model, detailing its formulation, and we apply it to a real-world case study to discuss advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other modelling frameworks. In particular, we model the national energy system of Switzerland to evaluate a 50{\%} renewable energy scenario.},

Newer scenarios are produced by various interests, ranging from environmental organizations to industry to an international organization, and represent a variety of carbon-free power generation technologies on the supply side. The reviewed studies reveal that the electrification rate, defined here as the ratio of electricity to final energy demand, rises in baseline scenarios, and that its increase is accelerated under climate policy. The prospect of electrification differs from sector to sector, and is the most robust for the buildings sector. The degree of transport electrification differs among studies because of different treatment and assumptions about technology. Industry does not show an appreciable change in the electrification rate. Relative to a baseline scenario, an increase in the electrification rate often implies an increase in electricity demand but does not guarantee it. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This requires the development of energy models to aid decisionmaking. Large scale energy models are often very complex and use economic optimization to define energy strategies. Thus, they might be black-boxes to public decision-makers. This work aims at overcoming this issue by proposing a new modelling framework, designed to support decision-makers by improving their understanding of the energy system. The goal is to show the effect of the policy and investment decisions on final energy consumption, total cost and environmental impact. The modelling approach and the model structure are described in detail. Final energy consumption is represented as the sum of three main components: heating, electricity and transportation. In this framework, a sequential modelling strategy allows the assessment of the competition between electricity and fuels in the heating and transportation sectors without increasing the model complexity. A monthly resolution is chosen in order to highlight seasonality issues of the energy system. Developed with the goal of being easily adaptable to any large-scale energy system, the modelling approach is currently implemented within an online energy calculator for the case of Switzerland.},

abstract = {The transition towards more sustainable, fossil-free energy systems is interlinked with a high penetration of stochastic renewables, such as wind and solar. In this context, energy storage technologies of different kinds - namely electrical, thermal and chemical - are commonly expected to play a major role; however, this role is seldom quantified using whole energy system models. In this paper, our goal is to assess and quantify the role of these different storage technologies in low carbon energy systems. To do this, we apply EnergyScope TD, a novel open-source energy planning model, to the real case study of the national energy system of Switzerland; concretely, we optimise the Swiss energy system for a target future year with an hourly resolution. The results indicate the following trends: (i) Thermal storage in combination with heat pumping becomes the main source of flexibility in the electricity sector; (ii) electrification allows a high penetration of renewables in the transportation sector, and the remaining share of mobility is supplied by synthetic fuels; (iii) a mix of storage technologies is needed for different applications at different timescales, such as synthetic fuels for long-term and for mobility demand, and thermal storage for short term (day-week) and for heat demand. Overall, it emerges that storage technologies - such as thermal storage, vehicle to grid and synthetic fuel storage – can help decrease cost, decarbonise the mobility and heating sectors, and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.},

abstract = {The Belgian energy system, in particular the electricity generation, is in full transition. To gain a better understanding of what the possible pathways are for this energy transition, Febeliec asked EnergyVille to develop an objective analysis of possible scenarios for electricity generation in Belgium for 2020-2030. The following questions are explored: 1) What will electricity generation in Belgium look like in 2020, taking into account current political decisions and in which the model choses the best economic options? 2) What will the Belgian electricity provision look like in 2020 and 2030, taking into account the most recent expert knowledge of technological options? 3) What impact will the possible political choices have on the related cost of the energy system transition? To get an accurate answer, the EnergyVille Belgium TIMES model, a techno-economic energy system model, is used to generate a set of scenarios in which assumptions on three sensitivity parameters, namely ‘the import capacity for electricity', ‘the fossil fuel prices' and ‘the phase out of nuclear energy' are being altered. Five scenarios are analysed:  Central Scenario: current trends on policies and global markets are kept;  10{\%} Import Restriction: electricity import is limited to 10{\%} of aggregated power generation;  Nuclear Extension: 10 year extension of 2 GW nuclear power capacity beyond 2025;  Low Fossil Fuel Price: assumes a low price level trend for fossil fuel prices;  High Fossil Fuel Price: assumes a high price level trend for fossil fuel prices. Central Scenario based on current trends on market and policies In 2016 55{\%} of the electricity generation in Belgium is provided by nuclear power plants and 14 {\%} by renewable energy sources. Based on the cost minimizing objective of the model, the results show that in 2030 electricity generation originates to an equal share from renewable sources and fossil fuel based installations. Wind onshore capacity grows from 1.5 to 8.6 GW, wind offshore from 0.712 to 2.2 GW and residential and commercial PV solar from 3.0 to 7.9 GW in the Central Scenario between 2016 and 2030. The natural gas based power plants and combined heat and power installations (CHPs) remain stable in capacity above 6 GW, but generation output increases from 24.3 TWh to 35.1 TWh by 2030. This generation mix exceeds the 13{\%} share of renewable energy generation in the final energy consumption as specified in the boundary conditions of the model for Belgium in the year 2030. The anticipated increase in net transfer capacity to neighbouring countries from 3.5 GW in 2014 to 6.5 GW is fully available in 2020 and results show electricity net imports of 15.6 TWh per year in 2030. With the closure of the nuclear plants and the increasing intermittent renewable production, electricity imports and gas plant based generation play a crucial role in the energy system. The two balance the growing and intermittent renewable generation output. In the Central Scenario, CO2 emissions in the electricity and heat producing sector increases by 25{\%} between 2016 and 2030 due to the increasing use of natural gas after the closure of the nuclear plants. Comparison of the sensitivity scenarios The results show a high level of variation in the amount of net electricity imports across scenarios, ranging from 6.2 TWh per year in the 10{\%} Import Restriction Scenario to 28.4 TWh in the High Fossil Fuel Price Scenario. The Nuclear Extension Scenario results show less natural gas based generation and less demand for natural gas based capacity compared to the Central Scenario. Investments in new gas plants (compared to the other scenarios) is in part delayed. From 2035 onwards, after the complete closure of the nuclear generation, other technologies will have to fill the gap. The variation among the overall system costs across scenarios is mainly driven by future natural gas price assumptions and electricity net import levels. Annualized investment costs in all five scenarios are stable with 1,818 to 1,974 M€ per year. The largest cost variation can be observed in the electricity import costs, ranging from 292 to 1,926 M€ per year followed by expenditures for fuels (mainly, but not exclusively natural gas), ranging from 1,259 to 2,678 M€. The overall costs for the power and heat generating system ranges from 4,800 to 6,400 M€ per year in 2030, with the Central Scenario marking the median spot at 6,180 M€. 5 The nuclear extension scenario and high fuel price scenario have lower CO2 emissions compare to the other sensitivity analysis. Under these boundary conditions the use of natural gas is to a large extent replaced by nuclear generation in the Nuclear Extension Scenario or avoided by electricity imports in the High Fuel price Scenario. This study provides facts and figures regarding technology choices and consequential impacts on the energy system as a whole. It does neither directly or indirectly predict electricity prices in general or for certain sectors. The scenario analysis with the Belgium TIMES model is based on a system cost optimization approach. It provides a technical and economic analysis framework to evaluate choices and resulting cost for the energy system of Belgium and can contribute valuable insights into consequences certain policy choices might have for the future.},

All evolutions are designed to meet the requirement of a 100{\%} renewable based national energy system by 2050. For this purpose, a baseline is developed which depicts an energy system without the stringent renewables' requirement. Next, different trajectories are sketched that lead up to a 100{\%} renewable coverage in 2050. The trajectories show that it is feasible to combine economic growth and comfort with far going deployment of renewable energy sources, provided a number of key options and effective policies and measures are being implemented. These options were deducted from several discussions with stakeholders via an open dialogue process, as well as with national experts, and finally, were presented to the Steering committee. The analysis leads to the undeniable observation that drastic changes in a multitude of areas throughout society are required to obtain the desired level of renewable energy penetration in 2050, but also that such a transition can be realised through various sectoral, technology and inter-temporal choices. In other words, this study describes a vast number of different trajectories leading to a 100{\%} renewable energy system iin Belgium in the long term, as well as their socio-economic impacts.},

  abstract = {Concerns related to climate change and security of energy supply are pushing various countries to make strategic energy planning decisions. This requires the development of energy models to aid decision-making. Large scale energy models are often very complex and use economic optimization to define energy strategies. Thus, they might be black-boxes to public decision-makers. This work aims at overcoming this issue by proposing a new modelling framework, designed to support decision-makers by improving their understanding of the energy system. The goal is to show the effect of the policy and investment decisions on final energy consumption, total cost and environmental impact.

The modelling approach and the model structure are described in detail. Final energy consumption is represented as the sum of three main components: heating, electricity and transportation. In this framework, a sequential modelling strategy allows the assessment of the competition between electricity and fuels in the heating and transportation sectors without increasing the model complexity. A monthly resolution is chosen in order to highlight seasonality issues of the energy system. Developed with the goal of being easily adaptable to any large-scale energy system, the modelling approach is currently implemented within an online energy calculator for the case of Switzerland.},

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous technoeconomic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead-acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni-Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

abstract = {Energy planning recently received more attention in Switzerland through the new strategy phasing out nuclear energy by 2034. Often however the energy planning is only done from the electrical side. Thiswork takes a different angel and helps communities and energy utilities planning tomorrows energy system from a heat based perspective. After the data collection and structuring, the methodology presented here designs an energy system. Based on the quality of the collected data, the approach to define the energy demand should be chosen. In order to reduce calculation time, a data reduction approach is developed to reduce the input data without loosing significant information and precision. In particular, the methodology focuses on the integration of a stochastic resource, in this case solar thermal heat production, in combination with thermal energy storage. The thermal energy storage can be used as a short or long termthermal energy storage. The framework compares design solutions for the two storage types considering either a total cost approach or a life cycle assessment approach using the cumulative exergy demand (CExD). The proposed mathematical programming framework is based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach, that canwork on different levels of detail between building to community or city level. The optimization problem can also be further simplified to a linear problem, increasing the size of problem that can be solvedwhile reducing or keeping a constant computation time. The discussed cases showan interest in further investigating storage solution using both, the short and long termstorage at once, because they allowto reduce the system's overall costs or CExD significantly. The framework is then extended to consider buildings as an energy storage. The building's internal temperature can be raised from 20 °C up to 23 °C, giving a comfort temperature range that can be used for storing heat. The integrating of both storage types, the thermal energy storage and the building as an energy storage, showno significant impact on the energy system design. However, costs or CExD can be reduced. In addition, the heat demand can be modified through the decision of optimal energy retrofitting strategy for a group of buildings. The framework decideswhich of the building to refurbish based the overall CExD including CExD used for retrofitting the building. Finally, a method is proposed to integrate uncertainty of the model's input parameters into the system design. A global sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of each uncertain parameter onto the system, allowing to focusing on the outputs of interest. Robust optimization is applied with a simulation-based approach, the additional costs for a robust design are calculated, as well as the different unit sizes. The low complexity of the developed models allows for an easy integration of new data collected during the development of a project, which is often the case in urban energy planning applications.},

abstract = {Oil is traded in a market where uncertainty, price volatility, and sudden supply disruptions are common characteristics. Natural disasters, political disagreements and wars can seriously affect supply and demand, and consequently economic activity. One particularly powerful tool of IEA member countries to respond to such disruptions is emergency oil stocks. In its history the IEA released stocks on three occasions, reducing supply shortfalls and the associated economic damage. This paper is expected to provide a general guide to the existing emergency stockholding system for countries who are considering the introduction of new stockholding systems or changes to their existing emergency stocks. It highlights the overall gains associated with emergency stocks and outlines important considerations for the establishment of stocks. In order to assess the economic benefits derived from holding emergency stocks this paper proceeds in four steps. First, it quantifies the costs involved in holding emergency stocks. Second, it assesses the benefits associated with holding emergency stocks. Third, cost and benefits are compared in order to assess the net benefits associated with the emergency stocks. Forth, the paper outlines different ways of financing emergency stocks based on IEA countries' practices.},

abstract = {A novel efficient hydrogen liquefaction process is introduced and analyzed. Two independent refrigeration cycles with different mixed refrigerants (MR) are used in the process which can produce 300 tons liquid hydrogen per day. The proposed process liquefies a feed of 3.450 kg s−1 normal hydrogen gaseous at 25 °C and 21 bar to equilibrium temperature (−195 °C) by the first refrigeration cycle with power consumption of 1.102 kWh/kgLH2. In the second refrigeration cycle, the hydrogen is cooled to −253 °C with power consumption of 3.258 kWh/kgLH2, enjoying the least total power consumption compared to the identical liquefaction plants. Thermal design of the heat exchangers and expanders at wide range of temperature and using innovative and appropriate mixed refrigerants according to the configuration are novel aspects of the proposed process. Also, composition of the first and second refrigeration cycles' refrigerants is another novelty of the proposed process. Energy and exergy analyses of the proposed process are investigated. The energy analysis reveals that coefficient of performance of the proposed process is 0.1797 which is considerably higher than the other identical processes. According to the results of the exergy analysis, exergy efficiency of the first refrigeration cycle, second refrigeration cycle and the whole liquefaction process are 67.53{\%}, 52.24{\%} and 55.47{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {Fossil fuels depletion and increasing environmental impacts arising from their use call for seeking growing supplies from renewable and nuclear primary energy sources. However, it is necessary to simultaneously attend to both the electrical power needs and the specificities of the transport and industrial sector requirements. A major question posed by the shift away from traditional fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources lies in matching the power demand with the daily and seasonal oscillation and the intermittency of these natural energy fluxes. Huge energy storage requirements become necessary or otherwise the decline of the power factor of both the renewable and conventional generation would mean loss of resources. On the other hand, liquid and gaseous fuels, for which there is vast storage and distribution capacity available, appear essential to supply the transport sector for a very long time ahead, besides their domestic and industrial roles. Within this context, the present assessment suggests that proven technologies and sound tested principles are available to develop an integrated energy system, relying on synthetic fuels. These would incorporate carbon capture and utilization in a closed carbon cycle, progressively relying mostly on solar and/or nuclear primary sources, providing both electric power and gaseous/liquid hydrocarbon fuels, having ample storage capacity, and able to timely satisfy all forms of energy demand. The principles and means are already available to develop a carbon-neutral synthetic fuel economy.},

abstract = {We describe a process for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere in an industrial plant. The design captures ∼1 Mt-CO2/year in a continuous process using an aqueous KOH sorbent coupled to a calcium caustic recovery loop. We describe the design rationale, summarize performance of the major unit operations, and provide a capital cost breakdown developed with an independent consulting engineering firm. We report results from a pilot plant that provides data on performance of the major unit operations. We summarize the energy and material balance computed using an Aspen process simulation. When CO2 is delivered at 15 MPa, the design requires either 8.81 GJ of natural gas, or 5.25 GJ of gas and 366 kWhr of electricity, per ton of CO2 captured. Depending on financial assumptions, energy costs, and the specific choice of inputs and outputs, the levelized cost per ton CO2 captured from the atmosphere ranges from 94 to 232 {\$}/t-CO2. An industrial process for large-scale capture of atmospheric CO2 (DAC) serves two roles. First, as a source of CO2 for making carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels, enabling carbon-free energy to be converted into high-energy-density fuels. Solar fuels, for example, may be produced at high-insolation low-cost locations from DAC-CO2 and electrolytic hydrogen using gas-to-liquids technology enabling decarbonization of difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. And second, DAC with CO2 sequestration allows carbon removal. The feasibility of DAC has been disputed, in part, because publications have not provided sufficient engineering detail to allow independent evaluation of costs. We provide an engineering cost basis for a commercial DAC system for which all major components are either drawn from well-established commercial heritage or described in sufficient detail to allow assessment by third parties. This design reflects roughly 100 person-years of development by Carbon Engineering. First direct air capture paper for which all major components are either drawn from well-established commercial heritage or described in sufficient detail to allow assessment by third parties. Includes energy and materials balances, commercial engineering cost breakdown, and pilot plant data.

abstract = {The increase in the global atmospheric CO2 concentration resulting from over a century of combustion of fossil fuels has been associated with significant global climate change. With the global population increase driving continued increases in fossil fuel use, humanity's primary reliance on fossil energy for the next several decades is assured. Traditional modes of carbon capture such as precombustion and postcombustion CO2 capture from large point sources can help slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, but only the direct removal of CO2 from the air, or “direct air capture” (DAC), can actually reduce the global atmospheric CO2 concentration. The past decade has seen a steep rise in the use of chemical sorbents that are cycled through sorption and desorption cycles for CO2 removal from ultradilute gases such as air. This Review provides a historical overview of the field of DAC, along with an exhaustive description of the use of chemical sorbents targeted at this application. Solv...},

abstract = {Looking ahead to 2050 many countries intend to utilise wind as a prominent energy source. Predicting a realistic maximum yield of onshore and offshore wind will play a key role in establishing what technology mix can be achieved, specifying investment needs and designing policy. Historically, studies of wind resources have however differed in their incorporation of physical limits, land availability and economic constraints, resulting in a wide range of harvesting potentials. To obtain a more reliable estimate, physical and economic limits must be taken into account. We use a grid-cell approach to assess the theoretical wind potential in all geographic locations by considering technological and land-use constraints. An analysis is then performed where the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) of the wind potential is evaluated. Finally, a top-down limitation on kinetic energy available in the atmospheric boundary layer is imposed. With these constraints wind farm designs are optimized in order to maximize the net energy flux. We find that the global wind potential is substantially lower than previously established when both physical limits and a high cut-off EROI {\textgreater} 10 is applied. Several countries' potentials are below what is needed according to 100{\%} renewable energy studies.},
