# Content and documentation #
This folder contains the fifth release (v2_3, hourly LP) of the EnergyScope model adapted to the Belgian case.  
This version has its pre-processing done in python (excel previously) and is based on the version proposed in [4].  
A documentation is available [here](https://energyscope.readthedocs.io).

Do refer to the documentation for:
- Model overview
- Releases and publications
- Model formulation
- Data used and sources
- License
- Get started and exercices
