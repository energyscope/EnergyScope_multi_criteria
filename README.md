===================

 
# Content and documentation #
This folder contains the fourth release (v2_2, hourly LP) of the EnergyScope model adapted to the Belgian case.  
This version of the model is an extension of the one in [4].  
A documentation is available [here](https://energyscope-td.readthedocs.io).

Do refer to the documentation for:
- Model overview
- Releases and publications
- Model formulation
- Data used and sources
- License
- Get started and exercices
